# E-Jet-Family-YV

## An advanced simulation of the Embraer Family for FlightGear.

This aircraft was modified and updated in a joint effort by the following people @2020:

- Gabriel Hernandez (YV3399)
- D-ECHO
- Tobias Dammers (tdammers / nl256)
 
# Installation

## From a Release Bundle (recommended)

- Get the latest release from
  https://github.com/YV3399/E-jet-family-YV/releases/latest
- Unzip in your Aircraft directory

## Github source bundle

- Get a source bundle from
  https://github.com/YV3399/E-jet-family-YV/archive/master.zip (or go to
  https://github.com/YV3399/E-jet-family-YV and click the green "Code" button)
- Unzip in your Aircraft directory
- **REMOVE THE `-YV-master` PART FROM THE DIRECTORY NAME**. The aircraft won't
  work properly if you don't do this.

## Using `git` (recommended for aircraft developers)

- `git clone https://github.com/YV3399/E-jet-family-YV
  $FGROOT/Aircraft/E-jet-family-YV` (replace `$FGROOT` with whatever is
  suitable - if you don't know what it should be, then you probably shouldn't
  be using this method). If you have a github account, you can also clone from
  `git@github.com/YV3399/E-jet-family-YV`, or fork on github and clone from
  your fork instead.

# About

Present pack includes the following Embraer Family variants:

- Embraer 170
- Embraer 175
- Embraer 190
- Embraer 195
- Embraer Lineage 1000
- ~~Embraer 175-E2~~

**A note on the -E2**

The real-world Embraer E-Jet E2 series is a complete overhaul of the original
first-gen E-Jet. The version included in this pack is nowhere near the real
thing; it is included because it was there when I (tdammers) started working on
it, but most of the improvements made to the other models have not been ported
to the E2. In its current state, it should be considered "broken". Doing the E2
right would be a gargantuan task, and I feel that doing it wrong isn't worth
doing at all.

~~Hence, the E2 is provided "as-is"; it probably doesn't work at all, and if it
does, then it is almost guaranteed to be incorrect in all sorts of ways. If
anyone wants to step forward, feel free to send patches - but for the time
being at least, consider the E2 "highly experimental" at best.~~

**Update (2021-03-18):** By now, the E2 has drifted from the rest of the family
to the point of not working at all anymore, so I decided to remove it. If at
any point anyone decides to dig it up and make it work, then resurrecting the
relevant files from git should be no problem; but in its current shape, the
only thing it did was confuse people.
